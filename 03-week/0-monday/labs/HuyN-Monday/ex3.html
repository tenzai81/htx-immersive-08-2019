        Here's what I like about lists:
    <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
    <li>That's about it</li>
    <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
     <li> When you make a list, do it in this order:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
        Decide if it's an ordered list or not
    <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
    <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
    <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
        <ul>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other
            <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li></ul> 
    </ul>
