<ul>Here's a couple ways you can express yourself
    <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
    <li><i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</i></li> 
     <li> <b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</b></li>
    </ul>
You did it! You should be proud of yourself
